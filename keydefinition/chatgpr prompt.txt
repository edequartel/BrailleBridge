You are an assistant that creates HTML + JavaScript that I can open in a browser.


Goal
Make an HTML page that connects to a WebSocket and reacts to braille display key events. And on the page is a maximum 40 character lines which is insync with the line on the brailledisplay. this can be done with:

postman request POST 'http://localhost:5000/braille' \
  --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  --body 'textToBrailleDisplay'

you can clear the brailledisplay line with 
postman request 'http://localhost:5000/clear'

The brailledisplay line must always be in sync with the line on the html page.

Cursorrouting refers to the letter of the string in the line.


WebSocket

* Connect to a WebSocket URL (I’ll change it later, so put it at the top as a configurable variable).
* Messages are JSON objects with at least these fields:

  * Kind (number or string)
  * Name (string, may be null)
  * CursorIndex (number, -1 if not used)

Assume my C# backend sends logical events like this:

{
"MsgType": 8,
"UnitId": 1,
"Strip": 0,
"ButtonIndex": 2097152,
"IsPress": true,
"Kind": 2,
"Name": "LeftThumb",
"CursorIndex": -1
}

or for cursor routing:

{
"MsgType": 11,
"UnitId": 1,
"Strip": 0,
"ButtonIndex": 9,
"IsPress": true,
"Kind": 1,
"Name": null,
"CursorIndex": 9
}

Interpretation of events

* Treat Kind as an enum:

  * 1 or "CursorRouting" → cursor routing key
  * 2 or "ThumbKey" → thumb key

* For thumb keys (Kind == ThumbKey):

  * Use the Name field to decide the action.
  * Possible names:

    * "LeftThumb"
    * "MiddleLeftThumb"
    * "MiddleRightThumb"
    * "RightThumb"
  * Implement a simple example behaviour, for example:

    * LeftThumb → move a selection left
    * RightThumb → move a selection right
    * MiddleLeftThumb → confirm / “OK”
    * MiddleRightThumb → cancel / “back”

* For cursor routing (Kind == CursorRouting):

  * Use CursorIndex as the index of a braille cell (0–39).
  * Implement an example where the HTML shows a row of 40 cells (divs or spans), and when a routing key is pressed, the cell at CursorIndex is visually highlighted.

What the assistant must output

* A complete HTML file in one block, ready to save as index.html.
* It must:

  * Contain minimal CSS to show:

    * Connection status (connected / disconnected).
    * A row of 40 cells for cursor routing visualization.
    * A log area that shows the last N events as text.
  * Include JavaScript that:

    * Opens the WebSocket.
    * Parses incoming JSON.
    * Uses Kind and Name / CursorIndex as described above.
    * Updates the UI accordingly.
* Use plain JavaScript, no frameworks.
* Use clear function names and comments so I can change the behaviour later.

Start your answer with a single <html> tag and give only the code (no extra explanation).
